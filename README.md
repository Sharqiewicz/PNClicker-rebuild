# PnClicker is a clicker game based on React and Redux.

 This is my first touch with these technolgies, so they might be better
 ways to do the same things I did. If you see some code optimilization, please write to me.

## Idea
 - There are four bioms - Fire, Water, Slime and Candy
 - All these bioms fight each other
 - Each biom has its own invidual statistics build and vulnerabilities.

## Gameplay
 - You have to choose which bioms you are and defeat all of yours foes.
 - There are diffrent foes in different levels of development of your
   charakter.
 - There are many tactics you can choose to develop your charakter.
 - In the end of the game are 3 bosses of enemies bioms!
    So, **Have fun!**

## Rebuild Idea
 - Better GIT history and code maintenance
 - Code optimilization
 - Learn SASS
